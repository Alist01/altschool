      <h1> MY REFLECTION</h1>
      <p><h3>MY JOURNEY SO FAR</h3></p>
      <p>Embarking on the front-end journey isn't without its hurdles. 
        Here are some challenges often faced by front-end engineers. I encountered a lot of challenges during<br>
        my journey of creating this(my official) website with alt-school. below are a few of the challenges that i encountered while creating this website;<br>
        <h3>1. Coding Challenges:</h3> As a beginner, I grappled with the intricacies of coding, each line a puzzle to solve. mostly during the stages of css.<br>
         knowing when to use flex, when not to use, what to do to make this site more beautiful and apealing to the eyes, that is a lot of work.<br>

       <h3>2. Power Supply Struggles:</h3>  Navigating web development in Nigeria came with the constant challenge of unreliable power supply, <br>
        where darkness often enveloped my workspace. low supply of power.<br>

        <h3>3. Limited Learning Resources:</h3> Scarcity of proper materials added another layer of difficulty, forcing me to embrace the unknown with limited resources.<br>
        <p><span>I know that my journey is just starting and there are alot of things that are yet to be achieved!!!</span></p>
